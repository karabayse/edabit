/*
In this challenge, you have to format a word using four specific methods of the
Markdown language that is used by Edabit to format the text in the Comments tab
and the Instructions tab (during the creation, or the translation, of a challenge).
Each of these four methods (or styles) is identified by the lowercased initial
letter of its name:

"b" is for bold
"i" is for italics
"c" is for inline code
"s" is for strikethrough
You are given two parameters: a string word being the word to format, and
another string style being the lowercased initial of the style to apply.
You have to implement a function that returns a string being the word surrounded
by the special characters used to apply the given style.

Examples
To correctly apply a format, the word has to both start and end with one or two
specific special characters.
There are no spaces between the characters and the word.
You can find the characters to use for this challenge and how to return
the result in the Comments tab!
Just click on the Formatting Help link that you
can find in the Comments tab of this challenge:
*/
function mdFormat(word, style) {

  // return the word surrounded by the special characters used to apply the style
}
